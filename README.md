# Find My House ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡²

**Find My House** is a modern **React + Next.js (with TypeScript)** project designed to make house hunting in **Zambia** simple and transparent.  
Many agents in Zambia exploit house seekers by overpricing or hiding opportunities. This app empowers users by giving them direct access to listings, removing the middlemen.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
